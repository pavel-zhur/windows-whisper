## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Issues**
   - Ensure your `.env` file is in the correct location
   - Check if the API key is valid
   - Verify you have sufficient OpenAI credits

2. **Audio Recording Issues**
   - Check if your microphone is set as the default recording device
   - Ensure no other application is using the microphone
   - Try restarting the application

3. **Profile/Hotkey Issues**
   - Profiles are switched with **1-9, 0** keys within the recording window
   - Make sure **Ctrl+Shift** is pressed and released cleanly (no other keys)
   - Check the system tray icon to see the current active profile
   - If hotkeys don't work, try running as administrator

4. **Application Won't Start**
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Check if Python is in your system PATH
   - Run from command line to see error messages

### Error Messages

- `No module named 'xyz'`: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again
- `API key not found`: Check your `.env` file setup
- `PortAudio error`: Restart your computer or check audio devices

## Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Settings

Add to your `.env` file to modify:
- Audio recording parameters (`SAMPLE_RATE`, `MAX_RECORDING_SECONDS`)
- UI appearance settings (`UI_THEME`, `UI_OPACITY`, `OVERLAY_POSITION`, `OVERLAY_MARGIN`)

### Profile Customization

Edit `profiles.yaml` to:
- Modify existing transformation prompts
- Configure all 10 profiles (1-9, 0)
- Change Whisper model settings
- Configure language-specific transcription
- Set up custom ChatGPT transformation prompts

### System Requirements

Minimum:
- Windows 10 (64-bit)
- 4GB RAM
- Python 3.8+
- Microphone
- Internet connection

Recommended:
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- 8GB RAM

- Stable internet connection

## Security Notes

1. **API Key Security**
   - Never share your API key
   - Don't commit the `.env` file to version control
   - Regularly rotate your API key
   - Set usage limits in OpenAI dashboard

2. **Data Privacy**
   - Audio is processed locally before sending to OpenAI
