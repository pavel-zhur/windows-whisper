   - Press `Ctrl + Space` from anywhere
   - Or click the system tray icon and select "Start Recording"

2. **During Recording**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Issues**
   - Ensure your `.env` file is in the correct location
   - Check if the API key is valid
   - Verify you have sufficient OpenAI credits

2. **Audio Recording Issues**
   - Check if your microphone is set as the default recording device
   - Ensure no other application is using the microphone
   - Try restarting the application

3. **Transcription Language Issues**
   - By default, the app uses English ("en") for transcription
   - If you're getting transcriptions in the wrong language, add `WHISPER_LANGUAGE=en` to your `.env` file
   - For other languages, use the appropriate language code (e.g., "fr" for French, "de" for German)
   - If translations occur regardless of setting, try adding a more specific prompt in your `.env` file: `WHISPER_PROMPT="Transcribe exactly as spoken. Do not translate."`

4. **Application Won't Start**
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Check if Python is in your system PATH
   - Run from command line to see error messages

### Error Messages

- `No module named 'xyz'`: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again
- `API key not found`: Check your `.env` file setup
- `PortAudio error`: Restart your computer or check audio devices

## Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Settings

Edit `config.py` or add to your `.env` file to modify:
- Default hotkey combination (`SHORTCUT_KEY`)
- Audio recording parameters (`SAMPLE_RATE`, `MAX_RECORDING_SECONDS`)
- Language settings (`WHISPER_LANGUAGE`)
- UI appearance settings (`UI_THEME`, `UI_OPACITY`)
- Temporary file locations

### System Requirements

Minimum:
- Windows 10 (64-bit)
- 4GB RAM
- Python 3.8+
- Microphone
- Internet connection

Recommended:
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- 8GB RAM
- Python 3.10+
- High-quality microphone
- Stable internet connection

## Security Notes

1. **API Key Security**
   - Never share your API key
   - Don't commit the `.env` file to version control
   - Regularly rotate your API key
   - Set usage limits in OpenAI dashboard

2. **Data Privacy**
   - Audio is processed locally before sending to OpenAI
   - Only the audio data is sent, no personal information
   - Transcribed text is stored only in clipboard
   - No data is permanently stored
